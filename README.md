# Bangalore Home Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting home prices in Bangalore, one of India's fastest-growing cities. Using a dataset containing information about various house attributes (e.g., size, location, number of bedrooms, etc.), we built a machine learning model to predict home prices based on these features.
